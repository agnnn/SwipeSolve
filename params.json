A player who pots\r\nboth the balls with the minimum moves scores better. Player likewise gets the opportunity to create\r\ncustom levels, share and challenge it to friends.\r\n\r\n### Custom Level layout creator\r\nFor the levels, we permit players to plan and create new levels to challenge other players. We can develop\r\na game application theoretically with an infinite number of levels. Players can continue making new levels,\r\nplaying them and offering them to their friends, and the other way around\r\n\r\n### Modules are as following:\r\n1) Game Board - Game Board of size N x N, where the actual gameplay takes place.\r\n\r\n2) Level Editor - Custom Levels can be generated by ‘Level Editor.' Level Editor contains number of\r\ningredients such as obstacles, texture, board size, etc.\r\n\r\n3) Solvable Custom Levels - There’s an AI check which makes it certain that the Custom Level being\r\ncreated and uploaded is solvable.\r\n\r\n4) Server Storage - To save levels created by our users, so that the custom levels can be\r\nplayed/challenged worldwide. Initially, all custom levels will be stored on a local server.\r\n\r\n5) Challenge Friends - It’s a strategy game, and the players can compete with each other on the basis\r\nof their scores (Not real time multiplayer).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPradeep Ravindran (@agnnn)\r\n\r\nOpeyemi Oyedepo\r\n\r\nTianyu Yang\r\n\r\nXiaojing Yang\r\n\r\nYixin Yao\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Application/Pages?
