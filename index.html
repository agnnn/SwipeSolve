<p>We reason to build up an application – “SwipeSolve”, for the smartphones running on Android which
includes potting two or more balls at the same time: by swiping it left, right, up or down. A player who pots
both the balls with the minimum moves scores better. Player likewise gets the opportunity to create
custom levels, share and challenge it to friends.</p>

<p>For the levels, we permit players to plan and create new levels to challenge other players. We can develop
a game application theoretically with an infinite number of levels. Players can continue making new levels,
playing them and offering them to their friends, and the other way around</p>

<h3>
<a id="modules-are-as-following" class="anchor" href="#modules-are-as-following" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modules are as following:</h3>

<p>1) Game Board - Game Board of size N x N, where the actual gameplay takes place.</p>

<p>2) Level Editor - Custom Levels can be generated by ‘Level Editor.' Level Editor contains number of
ingredients such as obstacles, texture, board size, etc.</p>

<p>3) Solvable Custom Levels - There’s an AI check which makes it certain that the Custom Level being
created and uploaded is solvable.</p>

<p>4) Server Storage - To save levels created by our users, so that the custom levels can be
played/challenged worldwide. Initially, all custom levels will be stored on a local server.</p>

<p>5) Challenge Friends - It’s a strategy game, and the players can compete with each other on the basis
of their scores (Not real time multiplayer).</p>
